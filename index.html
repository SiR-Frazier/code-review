      <h2>Hello World Project</h2>
        <p>For this project, my partner and I created a simple webpage using HTML and CSS showing viewers how to say "hello" in English, Spanish, Japanese, German, Pig Latin, French, and Kinyarwanda</p>
      <h2>Our Favorite Places</h2>
        <p>For this project, my partner and I created a webpage with our favorite places in Portland,Oregon. We created a list for the restaurants, movie theaters, and bars that we enjoy the most. We used HTML and CSS.</p>
      <h2>Resort Website</h2>
        <p>For this project, we created a fake website for a very expensive, fictional resort. We used HTML and CSS. The site includes a breakdown of the loding options, restaurants, location, and things to do on the island. Also, we added the resort packages available for customers to select from. You can view our site <a href="https://sir-frazier.github.io/vacation-site/">here</a></p>.
